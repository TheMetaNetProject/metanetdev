MetaNet OWL Code Generation

This plugin is a customized version of the OWL Code Generation plugin
developed by the Stanford Protege Development Team and distributed
with Protege 4.2.  Changes were made to support the MetaNet API which
is another plugin.

For the MetaNet project, this plugin should be used rather than
the default one.
