<h2>Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 4 Code Generation Plugin</h2>
<p>
This is an alpha release of a new  Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 4 code
generation plugin.  The purpose of this plugin is to ease the
transition from ontology development to application development.  It
generates java code allowing application developers to access and
modify an ontology.  It is similar to the
Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 3 code generation plugins 
except that the code generated by this plugin is used with
the <a href="http://owlapi.sourceforge.net">Manchester OWL api.</a>
The plugin provides access to the code generation capability through a
code generation menu item under the tools menu.  
</p>
I would like to give
special thanks to Berkan Sesan who tried this plugin out despite
several bugs and provided some very useful feedback.
