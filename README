Note: the development/build infrastruture is still evolving.  Here is
how we've ordered things so far.

Explanation of directory structure:

apps

    sources for programs, anything executable, etc.

components

    sources for libraries, api's, etc. common code that could be used by
    multiple apps

dist

    created by running 'ant install' and deleted if 'ant clean' is run
    from the top.  For distributable output of compilation.

docs

    non-autogenerated documentation

ext

    3rd party libraries or applications for which we have code that we
    compile ourselves, especially if we need to make customizations.
    (Currently empty)

lib

    3rd party binary libraries (e.g., jar files)

plugins

    sources for plugins (for Protege)


For Protege dependencies:

You must tell the build where Protege is installed using the PROTEGE_HOME
environment variable.  This is used for locating libraries that are
distributed with Protege, as well as for installing plugins when building
the 'install' target.
