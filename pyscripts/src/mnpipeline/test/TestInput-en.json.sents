Youths from poor and rural families consistently end up paying much higher tuition in China than children from affluent and urban families.
Yet they attend considerably worse institutions, education finance specialists say.
The reason is that few children from poor families earn top marks on the national exams.
So they attend lower-quality schools that receive the smallest government subsidies.
Top four-year universities in China have resisted pressure to expand enrollments.
So roughly half of all college students now attend less prestigious three-year polytechnics instead.
Leaders from some of the nation's largest Christian congregations are urging President Obama and members of Congress to find a way to agree on new revenue and spending cuts that will reduce the deficit while protecting the poorest Americans.
In a public letter, to be released on Monday just days before severe budget cuts are scheduled to go into effect, the groups urge that the fiscal debate be about "moral choices."
The letter blames both parties for risking the possibility that more people will slide into poverty.
"Moving from one crisis to another has slowed economic recovery and has kept Congress from finding a sound, moral path to fiscal sustainability," the letter says.
"Other important issues go unaddressed, all the while increasing cynicism about our political process."
