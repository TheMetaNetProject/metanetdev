Explanatio of pyscripts directory structure

/src    all python code
        subdirectories can be made for modules

        the content of /src will be installed into
        
            root/dist/lib/python

        so that they can be found with a single entry
        added to PYTHONPATH

/etc    misc. non-source code files, e.g. schemas, config
        files, etc.

/bin    stubs for executing code in /etc from the command
        line.  These can be shell scripts or python
        scripts that import and execute code in /src.
        No application logic should be in these stubs
        and they should presume that PYTHONPATH will
        include the content in /src

/test   tests and test data for testing the scripts
        in /bin, which must run after an 'ant install'
        Note that pre-install tests should live in
        test subdirectories under the /src subtree
